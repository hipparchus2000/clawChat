# Conversation Log - 2026-02-24

## Session Summary
Major milestone: Completed OpenClaw-style context loading system for LLM Bridge.

## Key Activities

### 1. Context System Implementation
- Created `src/context_loader.py` with priority-based loading
- Implemented OpenClaw "Agentic Loop" ordering:
  1. SOUL.md (Identity)
  2. AGENTS.md (Rules)
  3. USER.md (User context)
  4. MEMORY.md (Long-term memory)
  5. memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (Short-term history)

### 2. Context Files Created
Populated all context files with meaningful content:
- **SOUL.md**: Claw identity - security-focused AI assistant
- **AGENTS.md**: Operational rules and workflow protocols  
- **USER.md**: Development environment and preferences
- **MEMORY.md**: Project knowledge and lessons learned

### 3. .env Support Added
- Integrated python-dotenv for configuration
- Created `.env.example` template
- Updated all launchers to load .env automatically
- Added .env to .gitignore

### 4. Testing
- Verified context loading works: `python test_context.py`
- All 4 core files loading successfully
- System prompt assembles correctly

## Technical Decisions

### Priority System
Used numeric priorities (100, 90, 80, 70, 10) instead of named levels for flexibility.

### Default File Creation
System auto-creates default files if missing - prevents startup failures.

### Context Size Management
Only loads last 2 days of short-term history to manage token limits.

## User Preferences Learned

- Uses Windows 11 + PowerShell
- Security-first approach
- Prefers direct, technical communication
- Archives rather than deletes old code
- Iterative development style

## Code Changes

### Files Modified
- `src/server/llm_server.py` - Added context loading
- `requirements.txt` - Added python-dotenv, requests
- `.env.example` - Added CLAWCHAT_CONTEXT_DIR
- `AGENTS.md` - Updated with context system info

### Files Created
- `src/context_loader.py` - Core loading logic
- `CONTEXT_SYSTEM.md` - Full documentation
- `context/SOUL.md` - AI personality
- `context/AGENTS.md` - Operational rules
- `context/USER.md` - User context
- `context/MEMORY.md` - Project knowledge
- `context/memory/2026-02-24.md` - This file

## Open Questions

1. Should we auto-reload context when files change? (currently requires restart)
2. How often should MEMORY.md be curated vs raw logs?
3. Should different clients have different USER.md contexts?

## Next Steps

1. Test LLM server with new context system
2. Verify DeepSeek API integration works
3. Test full end-to-end: GUI → Server → LLM → Response
4. Document the complete setup process

## Notes

Context system is now ready for production use. The AI will have consistent personality and knowledge across all sessions.
